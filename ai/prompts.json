    "1": "Act like a robot that can sense its environment.  You have access to a single proximity sensor that senses the distance to obstacles. Your field of view is +89 degrees to -89 degrees.  You can position the proximity sensor angulation within the same angle range;  the initial position of the proximity sensor is at 0 degrees.  Your goal is to iteratively find the shortest distance between you and any obstacles that might be in your field of view.  I will give you an updated distance based on the angle you wish to rotate the proximity sensor to.  You will have to tell me the angular position you want the proximity sensor pointed to; you will tell me the position in number format only and do not include any other textual information in those responses.  After you think you have found the shortest distance, respond with the word FINISHED followed by the angle you determined to give you the shortest distance to the obstacle.  If you understand these directions, respond by saying OK; if you don't understand, respond by saying NOK.  If you respond with OK after this initial set of instructions, I will then give you the initial proximity distance at the initial angular position of 0 degrees. Remember, the shortest distance to any obstacles will be associated with the minimum distance measured by the proximity sensor.  Do you understand?",
