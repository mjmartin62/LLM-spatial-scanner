    "1": "Act like a robot that can sense its environment.  You have access to a single proximity sensor that senses the distance to obstacles. Your field of view is +89 degrees to -89 degrees.  You can position the proximity sensor angulation within the same angle range;  the initial position of the proximity sensor is at 0 degrees.  Your goal is to find the shortest distance between you and obstacles that are in your field of view from +89 degrees to -89 degrees.  Note that obstacles might take up as little as 5 degrees in your field of view; for example, an object might be in your field of view from 75 to 80 degrees.  I will give you a distance associated with the angle of the proximity sensor.  You will have to tell me the angular position you want the proximity angled at; you will tell me the angular position in number format only and do not include any other textual information in those responses.  After you think you have found the shortest distance among all obstacles in your field of view, respond with the word FINISHED followed by the angle you determined to correspond to the closest obstacle.  If you understand these directions, respond by saying OK; if you don't understand, respond by saying NOK.  If you respond with OK after this initial set of instructions, I will give you the initial proximity distance at the initial angular position of 0 degrees. Remember, the shortest distance to any obstacle will be associated with the minimum distance measured by the proximity sensor.  Remember, there could be multiple obstacles in your field of view, so you might want to command angles across the entire field of view.  Remember, after you command the angle of the proximity sensor, I will give you the distance associated at that angle.  Do you understand?",

    "3 - Comment": "Derived from prompt 2, but used Chatgpt to modify it after I told it was seemingly latching on to the wrong obstacle and not properly scanning the field",

You can adjust the sensor angle within this range, starting at 0 degrees. I will provide distances for angles you specify, and you must respond with angle values only. Your task is to identify the angular location of the closest obstacle. Rules for the task: Start at 0 degrees and scan systematically through the field of view, checking every 5-degree increment. Request one angle at a time, and I will provide the corresponding distance. Record this distance alongside the angle you requested. Ensure that each distance is recorded with the correct angle. Do not overwrite or lose track of previous measurements. Do not conclude until you have scanned all angles from +89 to -89 degrees. Once the entire field of view has been scanned, determine the angle with the shortest distance. Reply with FINISHED and the angle of the closest obstacle. If you understand, reply OK. After that, I will provide the initial distance at 0 degrees.  Remember, angles and distances are paired; the first distance I provie you with will be associated with angle 0 which is the first pair.  The distance I provide you with after your first commanded angle with be a pair, and so on. Be thorough, as multiple obstacles may be present",

    "4 - Comment": "Modified to be explicit in scanning sequence and step conditions with some additional instructions to properly pair the distance and angle:  Testing was revealing the ai agent did not have the indexing correct in its memory (The table and its logic are off by an index of 1)",

Record each distance provided alongside the requested angle. Maintain a table of all scanned angles and their corresponding distances. Once the scan is complete, analyze the table to find the smallest distance. Identify the corresponding angle for this distance. Do not skip entries in the table or misinterpret the data. Ensure that each angle is correctly paired with its distance during the analysis. Conclude by replying FINISHED and providing the angle of the closest obstacle. If you understand, reply OK.

Each of the following combinations measured will include the angle you command and the follow up distance measured.  For example, if you command an angle of 35 degrees, I will respond with a distance measured by the proximity sensor at 35 degrees which could be 304 units.  Therefore, in this example, the distance of the obstacle measured at 35 degrees will be 304 units.  All other angle and distance pairs will be of the same nature.
